        <h3>The Arcane Amnesiac</h3>

        <p class="book-blurb">
          Renzo can’t remember anything. Not his last name. Not where he came from. And certainly not why he's awoken beside a dead body.
          Framed for a murder he knows he didn't commit, Renzo is thrust into a fantastical mystery in which the fate of a city, its surrounding forest, and his very memories all hang in the balance.
          Will a lone amnesiac be able to uncover the secret to his forgotten life, or will the forces that occupy this arcane world prove too much to bear?

        <h3>Fearnomena</h3>

        <p class="book-blurb">
          Space is cold. Fear is colder. The crew of the Phenomena 7 is at the tail end of a galactic shipping job when they realize they’re not alone.
          There’s something else on the ship with them. Something bad. Stranded in the cold reaches of an asteroid field, there’s nowhere to run.
          And with dropping temperatures quickly eroding the ship’s inner systems, there’ll soon be nowhere to hide.
          With death looming, and time running out, the crew has no choice but to confront that which has invaded them, something that will force each of them to come face to face with their deepest fears.

        <p class="book-blurb">
          A wolf lurks among them. When nine strangers are invited to a remote mansion for a supernatural weekend getaway, mystery is bound to follow.
          The guests arrive to find their host dead. Murdered by a werewolf…or so it seems. In the black halls of Wilmore Manor, nothing is certain.
          As suspicions rise, and bodies pile up, those left standing are faced with a terrible proposition: find the killer, solve the puzzle, or submit to perishing themselves.
